# To ensure the long-term accessibility of experimental datasets acquired in the lab

## Materials:

• Lab computer: Where the datasets are initially stored.

• OneDrive (online storage): For cloud-based backups.

• External Hard Drive: For local backups.

## Procedure:

### Project Folders:
1. Create folders for each project.

### Data Storage:   
2. When acquiring the data, make sure to save it in the project folder.
3. Data filename should include the experiment date (e.g., 20210931)
4. Save acquired data in the appropriate project folder, ensuring files are named using a descriptive format: [Date]_[Sample Name]_[Experiment Description] (e.g., 20210931_BeadsInGel_Exp50ms_Laser638nm).
5. Create a separate metadata file for each experiment to store detailed information about the acquisition, sample, and experiment parameters.

### Initial Backup (OneDrive):
6. Create a dedicated folder in the lab's OneDrive account for storing backups.
7. Set up automatic synchronisation between this folder and the lab computer's designated data folder.

### External Hard Drive Backup:
8. Schedule regular backups of the data folder to the external hard drive. This can be done weekly or monthly depending on the risk of data loss and the data size.

### Verification:
9. Periodically verify the integrity of your backups by accessing files from both OneDrive and the external hard drive. Supervisor also need to do this. 

> [!NOTE]
> Data Retention: With the advice from the supervisor, establish a data retention policy to determine how long the data should be kept and how they should be archived or deleted.
